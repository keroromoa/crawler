I rescue many dogs from the Codlea public shelter and we have found these souls forever homes around Europe.

I was then away at University for three years, followed by several years working abroad, so having a dog was not an option.  Once I returned to the UK however, I was set on adopting a dog from a rescue. It took eight months to find the 'right' dog. His name is Dexter and he is a yellow Lab.

The Labrashepherd is a loving, tolerant and even-tempered dog with the German Shepherd caution and shyness expecially when meeting new people and Lab companionship. They are typically very calm and can be skiddish or submissive around other dogs and strangers.       The Labrashepherd makes an excellent family dog. They are typically good with children but can get rambunctious when they get excited. As with any dog they should be supervised around young children.       The Labrashepherd tends to shed heavily especially during the spring and fall.       The double coat of the Labrashepherd means lots of brushing.       The Labrashepherd is very responsive to training.       The Labrashepherd has some of the Germa    Dog walking, dog training, reading abou dogs lol',\n",
